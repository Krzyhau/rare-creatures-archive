Despite having low base atk and def, they can still put up a fight due to the armored suits and powerful weapons they bought after selling NFTs for profit. Their fight can be easily skipped by making a payment of 100000 kakacoins, which quickly rises in value as the game progresses, and if you skipped the fight, they will give you part of their kaka-funds near the endgame.",
